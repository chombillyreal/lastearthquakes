# This code is a C# program that fetches earthquake data provided by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and filters earthquakes that occurred in Turkey.

##The code downloads earthquake data in JSON format from a specific URL, parses the JSON data, and then iterates over the earthquake data to find earthquakes that occurred in Turkey. For each earthquake. ##that occurred in Turkey, the code extracts location, magnitude, coordinates, and time information and converts the Unix timestamp to a DateTime object. 
##Finally, it prints this information to the console.
